# Predicting_Temperature
This project involved predicting temperature using the humidity.csv dataset. Both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models were employed and evaluated to determine their performance.

i) For Linear Regression 
   a) MSE - 7.4
   B) R2 Score - 0.82
   
ii) For Polynomial Regression 
   a) MSE - 0.046
   b) R2 Score - 0.95

* Based on this score for my dataset 'humidity.csv' I found out that Polynomial Regression gives more accurate results compared with Linear Regression
